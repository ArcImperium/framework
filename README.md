# These Instructions Are Important

Once you arrive on the website, click the button that says "IN". 
It will take you to the keyboard of the Framework, which you will then need to click.

At the login page, click "Create Account" and put something in for your username and password. 
Disclaimer: your username and password are able to be seen by anyone, so be mindful.
Afterwards, you will need to refresh the page before logging in.

If the login is not working, there are a variety of possible issues.
First, make sure that you refreshed the page after creating your account.
Second, you can visit https://framework-elyl.onrender.com/names to ensure that the backend is not asleep (because Render does that).

The levels page shows the different levels (most of them are under construction), play levels 1 & 2 for now.
Start at the green square, end at the red square.
Draw a blue wire from start to end, going around the black square obstacles.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
